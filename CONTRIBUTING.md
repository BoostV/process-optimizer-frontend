# Contributing to Process Optimizer

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

Reporting a bug
Discussing the current state of the code
Submitting a fix
Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the BSD 3-Clause License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [BSD 3-Clause License](LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/BoostV/process-optimizer-frontend/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/BoostV/process-optimizer-frontend/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We use an automatic code fomatter called [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Run `yarn prettier` after making any changes to the code. If you use the supplied development container and use VSCode files are automatically formatted on save.
